  EmojiChar is a struct represents a single Emoji character and its associated
  metadata.

  ## Fields

  * `name` - The standardized name used in the Unicode specification to
    represent this emoji character.
  * `unified` - The primary unified codepoint ID for the emoji.
  * `variations` - A list of all variant codepoints that may also represent this
    emoji.
  * `short_name` - The canonical "short name" or keyword used in many systems to
    refer to this emoji. Often surrounded by `:colons:` in systems like GitHub
    & Campfire.
  * `short_names` - A full list of possible keywords for the emoji.
  * `text` - An alternate textual representation of the emoji, for example a
    smiley face emoji may be represented with an ASCII alternative. Most emoji
    do not have a text alternative. This is typically used when building an
    automatic translation from typed emoticons.

  It also contains a few helper functions to deal with this data type.
