  # DEPRECATED: regex scan, returns a list of emoji as char glyphs
  #
  # Regular expressions are incredibly slow in Erlang, so this was replaced with
  # an efficient binary scan.  It remains here in the code for two reasons:
  #   a.) historical purposes and learning
  #   b.) since we still use this regex in the ruby and node versions of this
  #       library, this allows us to easily test and compare to make sure our
  #       new algorithm produces identical results.
  #
  # Thus it is kept as public so we can compare it in test...

  # Binary pattern match scan to do the same as above!
  #
  # This looks deceptively simple, but before modifying it, bear in mind that
  # an EmojiChar rendered glyph can be represented as 1..3 utf8 codepoints in
  # sequence, and some of the longer sequences contain other sequences as
  # sub-sequences, so you want to always try to match longer sequences first, or
  # risk cutting a character in half.
  #
  # Essentially the logic here is:
  #   1. Make functions to pattern match on all known glyphs at binary head. We
  #      order these functions based on the bitsize of the pattern we will match
  #      against, to make sure we dont cut a character in half and get the small
  #      variant.
  #   2. If the function matches head of pattern (match), add glyph to head of
  #      our results accumulator and recurse on the remainder of the binary.
  #   3. If no pattern matches head of binary, chop of one utf8 segment and
  #      throw it away (non-match), recurse on the remainder of the binary.
  #   4. If end of the binary is reached, reverse the accumulator and return
  #      results!
