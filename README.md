Exmoji
======
An Elixir/Erlang library providing low level operations for dealing with Emoji
glyphs in the Unicode standard. :cool:

Exmoji is like a swiss-army knife for dealing with Emoji encoding issues. If all
you need to do is translate `:poop:` into :poop:, then there are plenty of other
libs out there that will probably do what you want.  But once you are dealing
with Emoji as a fundamental part of your application, and you start to realize
the nightmare of [doublebyte encoding][doublebyte] or [variants][variant], then
this library may be your new best friend. :raised_hands:

Exmoji is written by the same author as the Ruby [emoji_data.rb][rb] gem, which
is used in production by [Emojitracker.com][emojitracker] to parse well over
100M+ emoji glyphs daily. This version was written to provide all the same
functionality while being even higher performance. :dizzy:

Installation
------------

Add it to your deps list in your `mix.exs`.

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:exmoji, "~> 0.2.2"}]
end
```

To get the development version, you can pull directly from GitHub:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:exmoji, github: "mroth/exmoji"}]
end
```


Modules
-------
Full API documentation is available via standard module docs or here:

#### Exmoji
The main library, with detailed search and conversion functions.

Some examples:

```iex
iex> Exmoji.from_unified "0023-20E3"
%Exmoji.EmojiChar{name: "HASH KEY", short_name: "hash", short_names: ["hash"],
 text: nil, unified: "0023-FE0F-20E3", non_qualified:"0023-20E3"}

iex> Exmoji.all |> Enum.count
845

iex> Exmoji.all_with_variants |> Enum.count
107

iex> Exmoji.find_by_short_name("moon") |> Enum.count
13

iex> for t <- Exmoji.find_by_name("tree"), do: t.name
["EVERGREEN TREE", "DECIDUOUS TREE", "PALM TREE", "CHRISTMAS TREE",
"TANABATA TREE"]
```

#### Exmoji.EmojiChar
A struct representation of a single Emoji character and all of its
associated metadata.

This module also contains some convenience methods for acting upon these
structs. For example, `EmojiChar.render/1` will produce a bitstring
representation of an Emoji character suitable for transmission.  It understands
which Emoji have variant encodings and will do the right thing to make sure they
are likely to display correctly on the other end.

```iex
iex> alias Exmoji.EmojiChar
nil

iex> for e <- Exmoji.all, EmojiChar.doublebyte?(e), do: e.short_name
["hash", "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight",
 "nine", "cn", "de", "es", "fr", "gb", "it", "jp", "kr", "ru", "us"]

iex> for m <- Exmoji.find_by_short_name("moon"), do: EmojiChar.render(m)
["🌑", "🌒", "🌓", "🌔", "🌕", "🌖", "🌗", "🌘", "🌙", "🌚", "🌛", "🌜", "🌝"]

```

#### Exmoji.Scanner
Provides very fast searches against binary strings for the presence of UTF-8
encoded Emoji glyphs.  Whereas the Ruby and NodeJS versions of this library
accomplish this via regular expressions, the Elixir version relies on optmized
binary pattern matching, making it faster.

An example:

```iex
iex> for ec <- Exmoji.Scanner.scan("I ♥ when marketers talk about the ☁.") do
...>   IO.puts "Found some #{ec.short_name}!"
...> end
Found some hearts!
Found some cloud!
[:ok, :ok]

```

Please be sure to run `mix test` and help keep test coverage at :100:. (Note:
_excoveralls_ is currently lying, actual test coverage is 100%, but it
doesn't seem to catch dynamically defined functions. Do `mix coveralls.details`
and manually verify those for now.)

There is a full benchmark suite available via `mix bench`.  Please
run before and after your changes to ensure you have not caused a performance
regression.
